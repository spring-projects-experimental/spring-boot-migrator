____
Spring Boot Migrator (SBM) aims to help developers upgrade or migrate to https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot[Spring Boot] by providing recipes for automated migrations.
____

== Support and Requirements

✅ Java, JDK 17
✅ Maven
❌ Kotlin
❌ Gradle


== Documentation

- https://github.com/spring-projects-experimental/spring-boot-migrator/blob/main/docs/reference/user-documentation.adoc[User documentation]
- https://github.com/spring-projects-experimental/spring-boot-migrator/blob/main/docs/reference/developer-documentation.adoc[Developer documentation]


== Spring Boot 3.0 Upgrade - Interactive Web UI
We are working on automated upgrade from Spring Boot 2.7 to Spring Boot 3.0.

=== Try the Spring Boot Upgrade Tool
NOTE: **Use JDK 17**

. Download the https://github.com/spring-projects-experimental/spring-boot-migrator/releases/latest/download/spring-boot-upgrade.jar[spring-boot-upgrade.jar]
. Run `java -jar --add-opens java.base/sun.nio.ch=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens java.base/java.io=ALL-UNNAMED spring-boot-upgrade.jar <path-to-application>`

If any of your applications is on 2.7 and uses Maven (Gradle is currently not supported), we'd be happy if you
could give SBM a try and provide feedback of how it worked out.
It is very hard to come up with all the possible setups found in the wild and therefor we need you - the community - to provide feedback to stabilize the recipe.

Thank you!

== How SBM works

Spring Boot Migrator uses and is compatible with https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite[OpenRewrite,window=_blank],
a powerful mass refactoring ecosystem for Java and other source code.

Spring Boot Migrator offers a CLI to run recipes to migrate or upgrade a given application to Spring Boot.
For developing new and custom recipes, SBM provides an opinionated API compatible with OpenRewrite recipes
and a set of specialized resource representations to simplify recipe development for Spring Boot.


=== Scan application
A given codebase is scanned and a set of recipes gets evaluated against the codebase. +

image::images/scan.png[]

=== Apply a recipe
The list of applicable recipes is displayed and recipes can be selected from the list to be run against the codebase. +
The recipes either apply automated migrations or guide users on their migration journey.

== Spring Boot 3.0 Migrator - Java CLI

* Download the latest release from here: https://github.com/spring-projects-experimental/spring-boot-migrator/releases/latest[Spring Boot Migrator Releases]
* Start the application: `java -jar spring-boot-migrator.jar`
* In the CLI start by scanning the application `scan <path-to-application>`
* From the list of applicable recipes select the one you want to apply, +
e.g.: `apply initialize-spring-boot-migration` +
Spring Boot Migrator will now apply the migrations defined in the recipe to the codebase.
* To get help when using SBM use the `help` command

NOTE: When using Windows you must either escape `\` or use `/` as path separator, e.g. `C:\\my\\app` or `C:/my/app`

NOTE: **SBM requires a JDK 17.**


=== Building from source
* Clone the repository
* Change into root dir
* Run `mvn clean install`
* Find the jar in `applications/spring-shell/target/spring-boot-migrator.jar`

WARNING: **Some integration tests use Docker so you'll need Docker to run them. +
You can pass the `-DskipTests` flag to the `mvn` command to ignore tests.**
