= Spring Boot Migrator (SBM)

[quote]
____
Spring Boot Migrator (SBM) aims to help developers upgrade or migrate to https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot[Spring Boot] by providing recipes for automated migrations.
____

== Support and Requirements

✅ Java, JDK 17
✅ Maven
❌ Kotlin
❌ Gradle


== Spring Boot 3.0 Upgrades

We are working on automated upgrade from Spring Boot 2.7 to Spring Boot 3.0.

If any of your applications is on 2.7 and uses Maven (Gradle is currently not supported), we'd be happy if you
could give SBM a try and provide feedback of how it worked out.
It is very hard to come up with all the possible setups found in the wild and therefor we need you - the community - to provide feedback to stabilize the recipe.

Thank you!

Download the https://github.com/spring-projects-experimental/spring-boot-migrator/releases[latest release]

- Start SBM: `java -jar spring-boot-migrator.jar`
- Scan your application: `scan <path to application>`
- generate a report first: `apply boot-2.7-3.0-upgrade-report`
- Run the migration: `apply boot-2.7-3.0-dependency-version-update`

Please don't hesitate to ask questions and provide feedback.

If you decided you want to work on an issue, leave a comment letting us know that you want to work on it and we go from there.

Thank you!

== How SBM works

Spring Boot Migrator uses and is compatible with https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite[OpenRewrite,window=_blank],
a powerful mass refactoring ecosystem for Java and other source code.

Spring Boot Migrator offers a CLI to run recipes to migrate or upgrade a given application to Spring Boot.
For developing new and custom recipes, SBM provides an opinionated API compatible with OpenRewrite recipes
and a set of specialized resource representations to simplify recipe development for Spring Boot.


=== Scan application
A given codebase is scanned and a set of recipes gets evaluated against the codebase. +

=== Apply a recipe
The list of applicable recipes is displayed and recipes can be selected from the list to be run against the codebase. +
The recipes either apply automated migrations or guide users on their migration journey.

== Getting started

* Download the latest release from here: https://github.com/spring-projects-experimental/spring-boot-migrator/releases[Spring Boot Migrator Releases]
* Start the application: `java -jar spring-boot-migrator.jar`
* In the CLI start by scanning the application `scan <path-to-application>`
* From the list of applicable recipes select the one you want to apply, +
e.g.: `apply initialize-spring-boot-migration` +
Spring Boot Migrator will now apply the migrations defined in the recipe to the codebase.
* To get help when using SBM use the `help` command

NOTE: When using Windows you must either escape `\` or use `/` as path separator, e.g. `C:\\my\\app` or `C:/my/app`

NOTE: **SBM requires a JDK 17.**


=== Building from source
* Clone the repository
* Change into root dir
* Run `mvn clean install`
* Find the jar in `applications/spring-shell/spring-boot-migrator.jar`

WARNING: **Some integration tests use Docker so you'll need Docker to run them. +
You can pass the `-DskipTests` flag to the `mvn` command to ignore tests.**
