Properties:
-----------
Git Support enabled: ${sbm.gitSupportEnabled}

    - If `sbm.gitSupportEnabled` is `true` and the scanned project is a Git project,
      the git hash will be read during scan.
    - Before each 'apply' it will be verified that no uncommitted changes exist and that
      the stored git hash matches the hash read during scan or after last commit.
      If this is not true a new 'scan' will be done.
    - After each 'apply' it will be verified that no uncommitted changes exist and the Git hash matches.
      This prevents changes in the scanned project during 'apply'.
    - After each 'apply' an automated commit will be done and the new Git hash will be read.
    - If this flag is 'true' IT IS IMPORTANT THAT NO UNCOMMITTED FILES EXIST in the scanned project.

    Use -Dsbm.gitSupportEnabled=true|false as VM parameter on startup to set the property.

Base Package: ${sbm.defaultBasePackage}

    - The package for new classes when no base package can be calculated

    Use -Dsbm.defaultBasePackage=com.acme.packagename as VM parameter on startup to set the property.
