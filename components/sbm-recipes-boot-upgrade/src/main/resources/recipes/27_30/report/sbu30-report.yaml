            Dependency management for Apache Johnzon has been removed in favor of Eclipse Yasson.
            A Jakarta EE 10-compatible version of Apache Johnzon can be used with Spring Boot 3, but you will now have to specify a version in your dependency declaration.

            Upgrade application to support Jakarta EE upgrade
          remediation:
            description: |-
              Whenever Spring Boot depends on a Jakarta EE specification, Spring Boot 3.0 has upgraded to the version that is included in Jakarta EE 10. For example, Spring Boot 3.0 uses the Servlet 6.0 and JPA 3.1 specifications.
              If you are managing your own dependencies, and aren't relying on our starter POMs, you should ensure that you have updated your Maven or Gradle file appropriately. You need to be especially careful that older Java EE dependencies are no longer directly or transitively used in your build. For example, if you should always be using jakarta.servlet:jakarta.servlet-api and not javax.servlet:javax.servlet-api.
              As well as dependency coordinate changes, Jakarta EE now uses jakarta packages rather than javax. Once you've update your dependencies you may find that import statements in your project need to be updated.

        - title: Actuator Endpoints Sanitization
          helper: org.springframework.sbm.boot.upgrade_27_30.report.helper.ActuatorEndpointsSanitizationHelper
          change: |-
            Since, the `/env` and `/configprops` endpoints can contains sensitive values, all values are always masked by default.
            This used to be case only for keys considered to be sensitive.
            
            Instead, this release opts for a more secure default.
            The keys-based approach has been removed in favor of a role based approach, similar to the health endpoint details.
            Whether unsanitized values are shown or not can be configured using a property which can have the following values:
          
            - `NEVER` - All values are sanitized.
            - `ALWAYS` - All values are present in the output (sanitizing functions will apply).
            - `WHEN_AUTHORIZED` - Values are present in the output only if a user is authorized (sanitizing functions will apply).
            
            For JMX, users are always considered to be authorized. For HTTP, users are considered to be authorized if they are authenticated and have the specified roles.
            
            Sanitization for the QuartzEndpoint is also configurable in the same way.
          affected: |-

                  Please verify that none of the sanitized values must be plain text to meet your requirements.
                  If some sanitized values are required in plain text a custom `SanitizingFunction` must be provided.

#              - title: Reset behavior to prior 3.0
#                description: |-
#                  Because Spring Boot Migrator can't tell if the now sanitized properties are required in plain-text,
#                  the only automated change we can do is setting `management.endpoint.configprops.show-values`,
#                  `management.endpoint.env.show-values` and `management.endpoint.quartz.show-values` to `ALWAYS`.
#                  This means the application does not benefit from the new and more secure configuration in Spring Boot 3.0.0.
#                  We strongly recommend you adjust this configuration to your needs.
#
#                  WARNING:  This would result in some values not being sanitized when in 2.7 they would have been.

            align with the ISO-8601 standard. The new default format `yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSXXX` uses a `T` to
            separate the date and time instead of a space character and adds the timezone offset to the end.
            The `LOG_DATEFORMAT_PATTERN` environment variable or `logging.pattern.dateformat` property can be used to

        - title: Constructor Binding
          helper: org.springframework.sbm.boot.upgrade_27_30.report.helper.ConstructorBindingHelper
          change: |-
            When using constructor bound @ConfigurationProperties the @ConstructorBinding annotation
            is no longer required if the class has a single parameterized constructor.
            If you have more than one constructor, you'll still need to use `@ConstructorBinding`
            to tell Spring Boot which one to use.

            For most users, this updated logic will allow for simpler `@ConfigurationProperties`
            classes. If, however, you have a `@ConfigurationProperties` and you want to inject
            beans into the constructor rather than binding it, you'll now need to add an
            `@Autowired` annotation.

        - title: Spring MVC and WebFlux URL matching changes
          helper: org.springframework.sbm.boot.upgrade_27_30.report.helper.SpringMVCAndWebFluxUrlMatchingChangesHelper
          change: |-
            As of Spring Framework 6.0, the trailing slash matching configuration option has been deprecated and its default value set to `false`.
            This means that previously, the following controller would match both "GET /some/greeting" and "GET /some/greeting/":
            
            [source, java]
            ----

            public class MyController {
            
              @GetMapping("/some/greeting")
              public String greeting {
                return "Hello";
              }
            
            }

            As of https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/28552[this Spring Framework change], "GET /some/greeting/" doesn't match anymore by default.
            
            Developers should instead configure explicit redirects/rewrites through a proxy, a Servlet/web filter, or even declare the additional route explicitly on the controller handler (like `@GetMapping("/some/greeting", "/some/greeting/")` for more targeted cases.
            
            Until your application fully adapts to this change, you can change the default with the following global configuration:

            The `httptrace` endpoint and related infrastructure records and provides access to information about recent HTTP request-response exchanges.
            Following the introduction of support for https://micrometer.io/docs/tracing[Micrometer Tracing], the name `httptrace` may cause confusion.
            To reduce this possible confusion the endpoint has been renamed to `httpexchanges`.
            The contents of the endpoint's response has also been affected by this renaming.
            Please refer to the {actuator-api}/#httpexchanges[Actuator API documentation] for further details.
            
            Related infrastructure classes have also been renamed.
            For example, `HttpTraceRepository` is now named `HttpExchangeRepository` and can be found in the `org.springframework.boot.actuate.web.exchanges` package.

            Previously, the `server.max-http-header-size` was treated inconsistently across the four supported embedded web servers.
            When using Jetty, Netty, or Undertow it would configure the max HTTP request header size.
            When using Tomcat it would configure the max HTTP request and response header sizes.
            
            To address this inconsistency, `server.max-http-header-size` has been deprecated and a replacement, `server.max-http-request-header-size`, has been introduced.
            Both properties now only apply to the request header size, irrespective of the underlying web server.
            
            To limit the max header size of an HTTP response on Tomcat or Jetty (the only two servers that support such a setting), use a `WebServerFactoryCustomizer`.

            A bean that is annotated with `@EnableBatchProcessing` or that extends Batch's `DefaultBatchConfiguration` can now be defined to tell the auto-configuration to back off, allowing the application to take complete control of how Batch is configured.

          change: |-
            If your application is customizing metrics, you might see new deprecations in your codebase. In our new model, both tag providers and contributors are replaced by observation conventions. Let's take the example of the Spring MVC "http.server.requests" metrics instrumentation support in Spring Boot 2.x.
            
            If you are contributing additional `Tags` with `TagContributor` or only partially overriding a `TagProvider`, you should probably extend the `DefaultServerRequestObservationConvention` for your requirements:
            
            
            [source,java]
            ----
            public class ExtendedServerRequestObservationConvention extends DefaultServerRequestObservationConvention {
            
              @Override
              public KeyValues getLowCardinalityKeyValues(ServerRequestObservationContext context) {
                // here, we just want to have an additional KeyValue to the observation, keeping the default values
                return super.getLowCardinalityKeyValues(context).and(custom(context));
              }
            
              protected KeyValue custom(ServerRequestObservationContext context) {
                return KeyValue.of("custom.method", context.getCarrier().getMethod());
              }
            
            }
            ----
            
            
            If you are significantly changing metrics `Tags`, you are probably replacing the `WebMvcTagsProvider` with a custom implementation and contributing it as a bean. In this case, you should probably implement the convention for the observation you're interested in. Here, we'll implement `ServerRequestObservationConvention` - it's using `ServerRequestObservationContext` to extract information about the current request. You can then implement methods with your requirements in mind:
            
            
            [source,java]
            ----
            public class CustomServerRequestObservationConvention implements ServerRequestObservationContext {
            
              @Override
              public String getName() {
                // will be used for the metric name
                return "http.server.requests";
              }
            
              @Override
              public String getContextualName(ServerRequestObservationContext context) {
                // will be used for the trace name
                return "http " + context.getCarrier().getMethod().toLowerCase();
              }
            
              @Override
              public KeyValues getLowCardinalityKeyValues(ServerRequestObservationContext context) {
                return KeyValues.of(method(context), status(context), exception(context));
              }
            
              @Override
              public KeyValues getHighCardinalityKeyValues(ServerRequestObservationContext context) {
                return KeyValues.of(httpUrl(context));
              }
            
              protected KeyValue method(ServerRequestObservationContext context) {
                // You should reuse as much as possible the corresponding ObservationDocumentation for key names
                return KeyValue.of(ServerHttpObservationDocumentation.LowCardinalityKeyNames.METHOD, context.getCarrier().getMethod());
              }
            
              //...
            }
            ----
            
            
            In both cases, you can contribute those as beans to the application context and they will be picked up by the auto-configuration, effectively replacing the default ones.
            
            [source,java]
            ----
            @Configuration
            public class CustomMvcObservationConfiguration {
            
              @Bean
              public ExtendedServerRequestObservationConvention extendedServerRequestObservationConvention() {
                return new ExtendedServerRequestObservationConvention();
              }
            
            }
            ----
            
            
            You can also similar goals using a custom `ObservationFilter` - adding or removing key values for an observation.
            Filters do not replace the default convention and are used as a post-processing component.
            
            [source,java]
            ----
            public class ServerRequestObservationFilter implements ObservationFilter {
            
              @Override
              public Observation.Context map(Observation.Context context) {
                if (context instanceof ServerRequestObservationContext serverContext) {
                  context.addLowCardinalityKeyValue(KeyValue.of("project", "spring"));
                  String customAttribute = (String) serverContext.getCarrier().getAttribute("customAttribute");
                  context.addLowCardinalityKeyValue(KeyValue.of("custom.attribute", customAttribute));
                }
                return context;
              }
            }
            ----
            
            You can contribute `ObservationFilter` beans to your application and Spring Boot will auto-configure them with the `ObservationRegistry`.

            As a result of the integration with the Observation support, we are now deprecating the previous instrumentation.
            The filters, interceptors performing the actual instrumentation have been removed entirely, as entire classes of bugs could not be resolved and the risk of duplicate instrumentation was too high. For example, the `WebMvcMetricsFilter` has been deleted entirely and is effectively replaced by Spring Framework's `ServerHttpObservationFilter`.
            The corresponding `*TagProvider` `*TagContributor` and `*Tags` classes have been deprecated.
            They are not used by default anymore by the observation instrumentation.
            We are keeping them around during the deprecation phase so that developers can migrate their existing infrastructure to the new one.

            Explicitly configuring the store type for Spring session via `spring.session.store-type` is no longer supported.
            In case multiple session store repository implementations are detected on the classpath, a {docs}/web.html#web.spring-session[fixed order] is used to determine which `SessionRepository` should be auto-configured.
            If Spring Boot's defined ordering doesn't meet your needs, you can define your own SessionRepository bean and cause the auto-configuration to back off.
