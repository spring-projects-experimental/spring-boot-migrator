        https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-2.5-Release-Notes[Spring Boot 2.5 Release Notes]

        The Relevant Changes section lists all potentially required changes to upgrade the scanned application to Spring Boot 2.5.6.
        
        NOTE: JDK 17 is required for Spring Boot 3
        
        == Relevant Changes
        
        This section lists the changes SBM found to be applicable to upgrade the scanned application to Spring Boot 3.0.0.

      sections:

        - title: Changes to Data Properties
          helper: org.springframework.sbm.boot.upgrade_27_30.report.helper.ChangesToDataPropertiesHelper
          change: |-
            The data prefix has been reserved for Spring Data and any properties under the `spring.data` prefix imply that Spring
            Data is required on the classpath.
          affected: |-
            The scan found properties with `spring.data` prefix but no dependency matching `org.springframework.data:.*`.

            <#list matches as match>
              * file://${match.absolutePath}[`${match.relativePath}`]<#lt>

              ** `${property}`<#lt>
              </#list>
            </#list>
          remediation:
            description: |-
              Either add `spring-data` dependency, rename the property or remove it in case it's not required anymore.

        - title: Logging Date Format
          helper: org.springframework.sbm.boot.upgrade_27_30.report.helper.LoggingDateFormatHelper
          change: |-
            The default format for the date and time component of log messages for Logback and Log4j2 has changed to
            align with the ISO-8601 standard. The new default format `yyyy-MM-dd’T’HH:mm:ss.SSSXXX` uses a `T` to
            separate the date and time instead of a space character and adds the timezone offset to the end.
            The `LOG_DATEFORMAT_PATTERN` environment variable or `logging.pattern.dateformat` property can be used to
            restore the previous default value of `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS`.
          affected: |-
            The scan found no property `logging.pattern.dateformat`.
          remediation:
            description: |-
              Set `logging.pattern.dateformat=yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS` to fall back to the previous log format.

        - title: Banner support
          helper: org.springframework.sbm.boot.upgrade_27_30.report.helper.BannerSupportHelper
          change: |-
            Support for image-based application banners has been removed. banner.gif, banner.jpg, and banner.png
            files are now ignored and should be replaced with a text-based banner.txt file.
          affected: |-
            The scan found banner image files here:

            <#list files as file>
            * ${file}
            </#list>
          remediation:

        - title: Constructor Binding
          helper: org.springframework.sbm.boot.upgrade_27_30.report.helper.ConstructorBindingHelper
          change: |-
            When using constructor bound @ConfigurationProperties the @ConstructorBinding annotation
            is no longer required if the class has a single parameterized constructor.
            If you have more than one constructor, you’ll still need to use `@ConstructorBinding`
            to tell Spring Boot which one to use.

            For most users, this updated logic will allow for simpler `@ConfigurationProperties`
            classes. If, however, you have a `@ConfigurationProperties` and you want to inject
            beans into the constructor rather than binding it, you’ll now need to add an
            `@Autowired` annotation.

        - title: Spring MVC and WebFlux URL matching changes
          helper: org.springframework.sbm.boot.upgrade_27_30.report.helper.SpringMVCAndWebFluxUrlMatchingChangesHelper
          change: |-
            As of Spring Framework 6.0, the trailing slash matching configuration option has been deprecated and its default value set to `false`.
            This means that previously, the following controller would match both "GET /some/greeting" and "GET /some/greeting/":

            ```
            @RestController
            public class MyController {

              @GetMapping("/some/greeting")
              public String greeting {
                return "Hello";
              }

            }
            ```

            As of https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/28552[this Spring Framework change], "GET /some/greeting/" doesn't
            match anymore by default.

            Developers should instead configure explicit redirects/rewrites through a proxy, a Servlet/web filter, or even declare the additional route explicitly on the controller handler (like `@GetMapping("/some/greeting", "/some/greeting/")` for more targeted cases.

            Until your application fully adapts to this change, you can change the default with the following global configuration:

            ```
            @Configuration
            public class WebConfiguration implements WebMvcConfigurer {

                @Override
                public void configurePathMatch(PathMatchConfigurer configurer) {
                  configurer.setUseTrailingSlashMatch(true);
                }

            }
            ```

          affected: |-
            The scan found classes annotated with `@RestController` which could be affected by this change.

                 If no clients expect a response for requests with a trailing `/` nothing needs to done.

                If all rest controllers must serve requests with trailing `/`, a `PathMatchConfigurer` should be configured like so:

                ....

            Sorting repositories no longer extend their respective CRUD repository.

            The affected interfaces are:

            If one requires the old behavior one must extend not only the sorting repository, but also the respective CRUD repository explicitly. This was done so the sorting support could easily be combined with the List repositories introduced above.
