        The application was scanned and matched against the changes listed in the
        https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-2.5-Release-Notes[Spring Boot 2.5 Release Notes]
        as well as from https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/wiki/Upgrading-to-Spring-Framework-5.x[Spring Framework 5.x Release Notes].
        
        The Relevant Changes section lists all potentially required changes to upgrade the scanned application to Spring Boot 2.5.6.
        
        NOTE: JDK 17 is required for Spring Boot 3
        
        == Relevant Changes
        
        This section lists the changes SBM found to be applicable to upgrade the scanned application to Spring Boot 3.0.0. 

      sections:

        - title: Changes to Data Properties
          helper: org.springframework.sbm.boot.upgrade_27_30.report.helper.ChangesToDataPropertiesHelper
          change: |-
            The data prefix has been reserved for Spring Data and any properties under the `data` prefix imply that Spring
            Data is required on the classpath.
          affected: |-
            The scan found properties with `spring.data` prefix but no dependency matching `org.springframework.data:.*`.
            
            <#list matches as match>
              * file://${match.absolutePath}[`${match.relativePath}`]
              <#list match.propertiesFound as property>
              ** `${property}`
              </#list>
            </#list>

          remediation: |-
            Either add `spring-data` dependency, rename the property or remove it in case it's not required anymore.

        - title: Logging Date Format
          helper: org.springframework.sbm.boot.upgrade_27_30.report.helper.LoggingDateFormatHelper
          change: |-
            The default format for the date and time component of log messages for Logback and Log4j2 has changed to 
            align with the ISO-8601 standard. The new default format `yyyy-MM-dd’T’HH:mm:ss.SSSXXX` uses a `T` to 
            separate the date and time instead of a space character and adds the timezone offset to the end. 
            The `LOG_DATEFORMAT_PATTERN` environment variable or `logging.pattern.dateformat` property can be used to 
            restore the previous default value of `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS`.
          affected: |-
            The scan found no property `logging.pattern.dateformat`.
          remediation: |-
            Set logging.pattern.dateformat=yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS to fall back to the previous log format.

        - title: Banner support
          helper: org.springframework.sbm.boot.upgrade_27_30.report.helper.BannerSupportHelper
          change: |-
            Support for image-based application banners has been removed. banner.gif, banner.jpg, and banner.png 
            files are now ignored and should be replaced with a text-based banner.txt file.
          affected: |-
            The scan found banner image files here:

            <#list files as file>
            * ${file}
            </#list>
          remediation: |-
            remove image banners and replace it with text-banner with banner.txt file

        - title: Constructor Binding
          helper: org.springframework.sbm.boot.upgrade_27_30.report.helper.ConstructorBindingHelper
          change: |-
            When using constructor bound @ConfigurationProperties the @ConstructorBinding annotation
            is no longer required if the class has a single parameterized constructor.
            If you have more than one constructor, you’ll still need to use `@ConstructorBinding`
            to tell Spring Boot which one to use.

            For most users, this updated logic will allow for simpler `@ConfigurationProperties`
            classes. If, however, you have a `@ConfigurationProperties` and you want to inject
            beans into the constructor rather than binding it, you’ll now need to add an
            `@Autowired` annotation.
          affected: |-
            We found usage of `@ConstructorBinding` in following files:
            
            <#list files as file>
            * ${file}
            </#list>
          remediation: |-
            Remove `@ConstructorBinding` if it matches the criteria, please refer issue: https://github.com/spring-projects-experimental/spring-boot-migrator/issues/166[#166]
