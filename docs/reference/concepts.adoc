== Concepts

SBM offers commands to scan application source code and run recipes against it.
Recipes bundle actions to apply source code migrations or find information in the codebase.

An `Action` is a single step in a recipe and can be reused by other recipes.
Every `Recipe` has at least one ``Action`` and each Recipe and every action has a condition which defines if the recipe and/or it's actions are applicable.

The condition has access to all resources to evaluate to `true` or `false`.
If a recipe's condition evaluates to `false` the recipe is not displayed.
Actions with a condition evaluating to `true` are applicable and will be executed with the recipe.
When all actions of a recipe evaluate to `false` the recipe itself is not applicable.

=== Recipes

Recipes can be declared in yaml syntax or provided as Java bean definitions.

- See link:{repo}/blob/main/components/sbm-support-boot/src/main/resources/recipes/initialize-spring-boot-migration.yaml[initialize-spring-boot-migration.yaml,window=_blank] for a recipe in YAML syntax
- See link:{repo}/blob/main/components/sbm-recipes-mule-to-boot/src/main/java/org/springframework/sbm/mule/MigrateMuleToBoot.java[MigrateMuleToBoot.java,window=_blank] for a recipe as Spring bean.

=== Actions

Action is the starting point when developing a recipe.
Every Action has access to all resources and their ASTs through the `ProjectContext`.

[source,java]
....
class MyAction extends AbstractAction {
    void apply(ProjectContext context) {
        // analyse and modify AST
    }
}
....

=== ProjectContext

After scanning and parsing the source code of a given application a `ProjectContext` gets created.
The `ProjectContext` acts as facade to the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree[abstract syntax tree] (AST) of the project and provides an API to access project resources.

[source,java]
....
ProjectJavaSources pjs = context.getProjectJavaSources();
ApplicationModules am = context.getApplicationModules()
....

The `ProjectContext` represents the current application state in memory and provides access to all resources.
The API provides methods to retrieve and modify Java source, application modules and build files.
All other resource types can be retrieved using finders.

[[Finders]]
=== Finders

Finders are useful to access and filter resources.

[source,java]
.....
public interface ProjectResourceFinder<T> {
    T apply(ProjectResourceSet projectResourceSet);
}
.....

Finder have access to the `ProjectResourceSet` (see <<ProjectResourceSet>>) to filter/find resources and return the result.
The result is of the same type as the generic type `T`.

The ProjectContext provides a `search(..)` method to apply Finder.

[source,java]
.....
List<..> resources = projectContext.search(new PathMatchingProjectResourceFinder("/**/some/path/*.file"));
.....

Finders also provide access to specialized resources, resources that are not directly accessible through the ProjectContext Api.
Specialized resources like `SpringBootApplicationProperties`, `PersistenceXml`, `WebXml`, ..., can be retrieved by their ``Finder``s.

[source,java]
....
void apply(ProjectContext context) {
    SpringBootApplicationProperties p = context.search(new SpringBootApplicationPropertiesFinder());
    p.getProperty("cloud-profile", "some.property.key")
}
....

=== Application Lifecycle

==== Scan Application
The user provides a root directory to scan a project.
After scanning the given directory a set of preconditions is checked to verify that the scanned project can be successfully parsed.
See <<Check Preconditions>> to learn how you can provide additional precondition checks.

===== Parsing
When all preconditions are met the project resources are parsed and the abstract syntax tree (AST) gets created in memory.

===== Specialized Resources
After parsing the project resources a set of ``ProjectResourceWrapper``s is called and generic resources can be replaced
with more specialized resources providing a specialized API for these resources.
Think of replacing a generic XML file representing `persistence.xml` (JPA deployment descriptor) with a specialized
resource representation offering an API to act on a specialized "JPA deployment descriptor".
See <<Specialized Resources>> to learn how yo can provide specialized resources.

===== Creating the ProjectContext
After replacing specialized resources the ProjectContext gets created.

===== Display Applicable Recipes
With the `ProjectContext` in place SBM checks all ``Condition``s of recipes and their ``Action``s to find applicable recipes.
The resulting list of applicable recipes is then shown to the user to select and apply recipes against the scanned application.

==== Apply Recipe
The user applies a recipe from the list of applicable recipes.

===== Applying Recipe Actions
SBM provides the `ProjectContext` to the list of applicable ``Action``s and each `Action` modifies the AST through the
`ProjectContext` API. These modifications are only represented in memory.

===== Verify Application In Sync
After applying all ``Action``s of the `Recipe` the changes need to be written back to filesystem.
When `sbm.gitSupportEnabled` is `true` SBM verifies that nothing changed in the scanned project while the recipe was applied.
If the git hash changed or non-indexed resources are found the changes are rolled back, the project must be synced,
re-scanned and the recipe needs to be re-applied.

===== Writing Back Changes
When git support is disabled or the project is in sync the in-memory representation is written back to the file system.

===== Commit Changes
When git support is enabled SBM commits the changes applied by running the recipe and the next recipe can be applied.


=== Modules

Since 0.9.0 SBM starts to support https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-multiple-modules.html#the-reactor[multi module applications].


=== Spring Boot Resources

==== Spring RestController Bean
Classes annotated with Spring `@RestController` annotation can be found using the `FindRestControllerBeans` finder.

[source,java]
.....
List<RestControllerBean> restController = projectContext.search(new FindRestControllerBeans());

List<RestMethod> restMethods = restController.get(0).getRestMethods();

restMethods.get(0).
.....
