                                          ==== What Changed
                                          Support for Elasticsearch's high-level REST client has been removed.
                                          In its place, auto-configuration for Elasticsearch's new Java client has been introduced.
                                          Similarly, support for the Spring Data Elasticsearch templates that built on top of the high-level REST client has been removed.
                                          In its place, auto-configuration for the new templates that build upon the new Java client has been introduced.
                                          See https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/elasticsearch/docs/current/reference/html/#elasticsearch.clients[the Elasticsearch section of the reference documentation] for further details.
                                          
                                          `ReactiveElasticsearchRestClientAutoConfiguration` has been renamed to `ReactiveElasticsearchClientAutoConfiguration` and has moved from `org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.data.elasticsearch` to `org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.elasticsearch`.
                                          Any auto-configuration exclusions or ordering should be updated accordingly.
                                          
                                          ==== Why is the application affected
                                          Actually, we don't know if the scanned application is really affected by this change.
                                          But we found a dependency matching regex `org\\.springframework\\.data\\:spring-data-elasticsearch\\:.*`.
                                          This indicates that the scanned application might be affected.
                                          
                                          ==== Remediation
