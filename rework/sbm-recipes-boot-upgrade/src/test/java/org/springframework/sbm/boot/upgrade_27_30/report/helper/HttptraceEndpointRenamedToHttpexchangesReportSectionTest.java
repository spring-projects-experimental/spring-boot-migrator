                                          ==== What Changed
                                          The `httptrace` endpoint and related infrastructure records and provides access to information about recent HTTP request-response exchanges.
                                          Following the introduction of support for https://micrometer.io/docs/tracing[Micrometer Tracing], the name `httptrace` may cause confusion.
                                          To reduce this possible confusion the endpoint has been renamed to `httpexchanges`.
                                          The contents of the endpoint's response has also been affected by this renaming.
                                          Please refer to the {actuator-api}/#httpexchanges[Actuator API documentation] for further details.
                                          
                                          Related infrastructure classes have also been renamed.
                                          For example, `HttpTraceRepository` is now named `HttpExchangeRepository` and can be found in the `org.springframework.boot.actuate.web.exchanges` package.
                                          
                                          ==== Why is the application affected
                                          Actually, we don't know if the scanned application is really affected by this change.
                                          But we found a dependency matching regex `org\\.springframework\\.boot\\:spring-boot-actuator\\:.*`.
                                          This indicates that the scanned application might be affected.
